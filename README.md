# Algorithm Study

What I've studied from July to Oct 2019.

I used below web sites.

1] https://lms.algorithmlabs.io/courses (private site)

2] https://swexpertacademy.com/ (Samsung Algorithm Website) 

My goal was to solve those problems as fast as I could.

lms site 5~30 min
mock exam problems: 30~45 min
