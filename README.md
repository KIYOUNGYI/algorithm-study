# Algorithm Study

What I've studied from July to Oct 2019.

Mostly, I used below web sites.
1] https://lms.algorithmlabs.io/courses (private site)
2] https://swexpertacademy.com/ (Samsung Algorithm Website) 

I practiced over and over again to solve those problems in proper time.

Depend on problem difficulty, I tried to solve those problems from 5 minutes to 45 minutes.

So I solved same questions over and over until I design the algorithm and do actual coding in proper time.

Most of the problems from algorithmlabs, I tried to finish them in less than 10 ~ 30 minutes.

Samsung Mock Exam test problems, I practiced them over and over to solve them in 30~45 minutes.
