# Algorithm Study

What I've studied from July to Oct 2019.

I used below web sites.

1] https://lms.algorithmlabs.io/courses (private site)

2] https://swexpertacademy.com/ (Samsung Algorithm Website) 

I practiced multiple times to solve them to make sure that I can deal with them in a short time.

Most of the problems from Algorithmlabs website, I tried to solve each problem in less than 10 ~ 30 minutes.

Samsung Mock Exam test problems, I practiced them repeatedly to solve those problems in 30~45 minutes.
