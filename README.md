# Algorithm Study

I used below web sites.

This Year(2020)
https://www.acmicpc.net/

Last Year(2019)
a] https://swexpertacademy.com/ (Samsung Algorithm Website) 
b] https://lms.algorithmlabs.io/courses (private site)

My goal is to solve algorithm problem as fast as possible.

# What I Practiced

1] Simulation(Brute Force)

2] BFS, DFS

3] Basic Number Theory(Math)

4] BackTracking(Recursion)

5] Divide & Conquer, Memoization, Dynamic Programming

6] Sorting Algorithm (merge,qucik etc)

7] String

8] Queue, Stack

9] Binary Search, Parametric Search

10] Graph Algorithm(Dijkstra, Kruskal, SCT)
